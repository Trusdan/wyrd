# Changelog

## Unreleased

S1a slice compiler, part 1 of 4: lexer, block parser, diagnostics, and parse-level `check`.

- Lexical and block rules from grammar v1 sections 1–6, with golden cases for each rule.
- `facts` entries are parsed into a `WyrdFactSchema` (stored, resolved, invalidation, and a trailing `doc` string).
- CLI `check` prints `path:line:col: error[CODE]: message` and exits 1 when a file has errors.
- Gullhaven example `example/content/gullhaven/ferry_toll.wyrd`.
- Conditions, quest and scene statement semantics, linking, `tag-lines`, and `export-json` stay later.
- Grammar v1 §4 example corrected so source `{{two coins}` displays as `{two coins}`. Quoted titles are never interpolated, and a trailing `//` comment may follow `language 1`. Example corrected and clarifications approved by Corey, 2026-10-14.
