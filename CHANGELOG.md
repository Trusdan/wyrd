# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Slot states `unwilling($h)`, `barred`, `locked_gone`, and `contested` resolve live. Precedence is `locked_gone`, `contested`, `empty`, then `barred`, `hostile`, `unwilling`, `successor`, and `default`, and the first covered variant wins. `outcome = route_closed` keeps the quest open and is readable with `outcome(quest, branch)`. Coverage warns for a used slot with no `empty` variant, a `locked_at` slot with no `locked_gone` variant, a constant `unwilling` or `barred` condition, and a branch whose every reachable route closes. A quest resolution logs one filterable `slot_state` line.
- A `role <id>` block compiles `scope`, `eligibility`, `default_holder`, `visibility`, `succession`, and `vacancy`. `roles.define()` stores the same definition. `eligible(role, entity)` tests `candidate`. `relation` succession also requires eligibility. `faction_assigns` picks a living eligible member by `faction_rank` and a seeded tie-break. `host_decides` and `election` stay `contested` until `assign`. `election` emits `election_needed` and calls `WyrdElectionAdapter.start_election`. `vacancy: abolish` runs when a strategy finds nobody.
- Slot state `contested` sits after `locked_gone` and before `empty`. A missing `contested` variant uses the `empty` variant and the state stays `contested`. A `contested` variant does not cover the empty lint.
- `line_ready` carries the speaker entity and the role ids they hold in that scene. A successor records `role_changed` and is never the departed holder. Each succession step logs one filterable `succession` line.

## 0.1.0-s3 - 2026-10-15

Packaging for a host pin. `tools/vendor_wyrd.sh` copies `addons/wyrd` and writes `VERSION`. See `docs/host-checklist.md`. Tags before 1.0 are for the host check only.

WFR13 host world events. A pack declares an `events` block. `Wyrd.events.emit` type-checks the payload, drops `on_event` caches (a pattern key drops every concrete cache), and re-checks dirty conditions before it returns. `begin_batch` / `end_batch` coalesce that re-check. A missing invalidate mode on a resolved fact is `E_RESOLVER_NO_INVALIDATE`. A wait that reads a resolved fact with an empty or `per_query` mode is `E_WAIT_RESOLVER_MODE`. The event log is not part of `save_state`. See `docs/events-draft.md`.

S2 slice runtime. S2 exit met: a save loads back to the same state, a recorded trace replays the same decisions, and the Gullhaven playtest scene is the project main scene (`docs/playtest.md`).

- `save_state` / `load_state` store schema version 1, language version, pack ids and manifest hashes, facts, the deed log, relationship baselines and kinds, role bindings and history, quest status, stage, outcomes, slot locks, and frozen journal text, plus every named RNG stream. 64-bit values are hex. A save during an open scene is refused. A hash mismatch warns in a debug build and is silent in a release. The migration table is empty.
- `WyrdTrace` records host answers and Wyrd decisions. Replaying the inputs on a fresh runtime reproduces the decisions. A changed host answer shows up in the diff.
- `await_host <screen_id> returns { <field>, ... }` is approved and parsed. It pauses the remaining stage-entry steps until `complete_host_step`.

S2c quest runner, scene runner, and the six slice effects.

- `set`, `inc`, `record deed`, `unlock topic`, `do` / `on_fail`, and `outcome` run at play time. Provenance stores scene, choice, and game minutes.
- Quest statuses include unavailable when `requires` names another pack. `start when` and `waits_until` advance only after a dirty re-check. A stage offers a scene; the host opens it. An aborted scene stays pending.
- A quest completes when every declared outcome is resolved and the current body has no transition. A `failed` outcome fails the quest.
- Journal text and its date freeze at the write. The default date is `day N, HH:MM` from game minutes. A host may register another formatter.
- Dialogue text is always on screen. `line_audio` may be null. Audio does not hide a line or advance it. `advance()` is the only way on. `can_save()` is false while a scene is open.
- `request_host_step` / `complete_host_step` are the runtime API a host step uses. The statement form is approved in S2d.

S2a runtime core and fact store. The Gullhaven manifest loads into a runtime, facts and conditions evaluate against the fake host, and a dirty re-check matches a full scan. Deeds, quests, scenes, and saves are later slices.

PCG32 swap: `WyrdRng` is now an in-script PCG32 (XSH-RR 64/32) with streams, per-decision seeding and saveable state; sequences no longer depend on the Godot version. Seeded bench fixtures were regenerated.

- New `tag-lines` ids follow this sequence. An id already written on a line is not rewritten.

S1d slice compiler, part 4 of 4: linking and the pack CLI. Draft, not frozen (`docs/statements-draft.md`). S1 exit met.

- `check` links a pack: merged facts, quests, scenes, speakers, commands, line ids, and the fact cross-reference.
- `WyrdContentManifest` plus optional `wyrd_commands.json`. A directory with no manifest is one pack named after the folder.
- `tag-lines`, `export-json`, and `facts`. `export-json` is a debug document, not the runtime load format. `test` stays unimplemented.
- Gullhaven is a four-file slice. `check --manifest` on `harbor.wyrdmanifest.tres` is clean.

S1b-perf: dependency index, dirty-set benchmark, and the condition-evaluator speed pass. Draft, not a CI gate (`docs/spikes/s0-condition-speed.md`).

- `WyrdDepIndex` maps exact keys and `{id}` patterns to condition indexes. A pattern depends on the whole key. The index is rebuilt from `reads` and is never saved.
- The seeded 10k-fact / 5k-condition bench times dirty-set ticks at 1, 10, and 100 changed facts. Incremental results must match a full scan. Timings stay informational.
- `WyrdRpnEval` lives in `runtime/conditions`. `tests/support/wyrd_rpn_eval.gd` is a thin shim. Saved opcodes are unchanged.
- The measured speed pass kept fact-slot loads, frequency-ordered dispatch, and load-time superinstructions. A fixed stack, hoisting consts, and an inlined jump pop were slower or not reliable, and were dropped. Numbers are in the spike doc.

S1c slice compiler, part 3 of 4: statements and effects. Draft, not frozen (`docs/statements-draft.md`).

- Quest, stage, slot, variant, scene, line, choice, and effect records, compiled from the block tree.
- Slice effects: `set`, `inc`, `record deed`, `unlock topic`, `do`, and `outcome`. Stored facts only.
- `#line:` required on spoken lines, journal entries, and choice labels.
- `check` runs the single-file pipeline through statements. Linking, `tag-lines`, and `export-json` stay in PR 5. The S1b-perf pass is a separate change.

S1b slice compiler, part 2 of 4: condition language. Draft, not frozen (`docs/conditions-draft.md`).

- Expression lexer, parser, type checker, and flat instruction emit, including prose interpolation spans.
- `WyrdFactSchema.lookup` and a signature registry (belief names registered and marked M5).
- Specificity, fact reads (including short-circuit arms), and a test-only stack walker.
- 10k-fact / 5k-condition benchmark recorded beside the placeholder runner. Not a CI gate.
- S1b left quest and scene statements uncompiled. Linking, `tag-lines`, and `export-json` stayed for later.

S1a slice compiler, part 1 of 4: lexer, block parser, diagnostics, and parse-level `check`.

- Lexical and block rules from grammar v1 sections 1–6, with golden cases for each rule.
- `facts` entries are parsed into a `WyrdFactSchema` (stored, resolved, invalidation, and a trailing `doc` string).
- CLI `check` prints `path:line:col: error[CODE]: message` and exits 1 when a file has errors.
- Gullhaven example `example/content/gullhaven/ferry_toll.wyrd`.
- Conditions, quest and scene statement semantics, linking, `tag-lines`, and `export-json` stay later.
- Grammar v1 §4 example corrected so source `{{two coins}` displays as `{two coins}`. Quoted titles are never interpolated, and a trailing `//` comment may follow `language 1`. Example corrected and clarifications approved by Corey, 2026-10-14.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-10-14

S0 skeleton. No runtime features yet.

- Godot project layout, editor-plugin stub, and versioned runtime facade.
- Typed adapter stubs, a seeded RNG wrapper, and a stable hash.
- Fake host, GUT 9.7.1, a placeholder benchmark runner, and CI.
- Grammar v1: lexical and block rules approved (Corey, 2026-10-14) and frozen. Quest, scene, and facts examples stay illustrations.
